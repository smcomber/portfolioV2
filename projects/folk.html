      <p>If anybody ever fit the image of the archetypal American folk singer, it was Woodrow Wilson Guthrie. Born in the heartland, he wandered from place to place with a guitar slung over his shoulder, writing songs and poems about the plight of America's losers and outsiders, tenant farmers and factory workers, framing them in a twangy Oklahoma accent and a self-depreciating sense of irony. Though perhaps best known for his topical songs about the Dust Bowl era, he also created a whole body of children's songs, a series of social protest songs like "Vigilante Man" and "Pretty Boy Floyd," and national commentaries including "Pastures of Plenty" and "This Land Is Your Land." Guthrie defined a new genre in American roots music, and his musical children range from Pete Seeger to Bruce Springsteen, from Bob Dylan to Billy Bragg; his 1,000-plus songs won him election to the Nashville Songwriters' Hall of Fame and, in 1988, to the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame.</p>

      <p>Considered by many to be the dean of the folk revival movement, Pete Seeger was a New Englander, the son of distinguished musicologist Charles Seeger. After dropping out of Harvard, Seeger took a job assisting Alan Lomax, meeting legends like Woody Guthrie and Lead Belly. After stints with a group called the Almanac Singers and a tour in the army during World War II, Seeger returned to the New York folk scene. He helped to popularize the five-string banjo and wrote a popular instruction book for it. He was a mainstay of the singing group the Weavers, and since the 1960s has maintained a successful solo career with dozens of albums to his credit.</p>

      <p>No artist in our time has mastered as many genres of American roots music as Bob Dylan. In a career that has spanned four decades, he has created masterpieces of traditional folk, protest music, folk rock, rock & roll, country, gospel and blues; in each he has pushed the envelope, using elements of older forms to synthesize a remarkable body of work that has made him one of the 20th century's most influential artists. From classic protest songs like "Blowin' in the Wind" to gentle country standards like "Lay, Lady, Lay," from the folk rock of "Hey, Mister Tamborine Man" to the rock of "Like a Rolling Stone," Dylan's work has raised the level of songwriting itself, and his ability to continually reinvent his music has been a lesson to generations of fans and admirers. Born Robert Allen Zimmerman in Duluth, MN in 1941, Dylan initially won fame as an imitator of Woody Guthrie, relocating to New York in 1961 with the express purpose of meeting his idol. He fulfilled his goal, but also quickly won fame as a singer in Greenwich village clubs, writing startlingly original songs like "Masters of War." A contract with Columbia and a series of influential, largely acoustic albums followed</p>
